# The Rise and Fall of The Simpsons

Like many people born in the late 80's or early 90's, I grew up loving "The Simpsons". 

There are three questions are guaranteed to send fans into a civil war:
1. What's the best episode?
2. When did the show start to get bad?
3. In 'You Only Move Twice,' did Homer mean he saw someone say 'Goodbye' to a shoe before that gag?

Well, the first question is easily settled (it's definitely not "Lisa the Vegetarian" - because you don't win friends with salad), the third is an eternal mystery and the question of the show's decline will always be up to debate -- well I hope to at least shine some light on this here.

An episode from The Simpsons' eighth season called “The Simpsons Spin-off Showcase” ended with a mocking song called “They’ll Never Stop The Simpsons”, which saw the writers poke fun at themselves and claim “we’ve got stories for years!” Some of the stories referenced in the song included: “Marge becomes a robot,” “maybe Moe gets a cellphone” and “a crazy wedding where… something happens.”

The episode aired in the heady days of 1997 when The Simpsons was in a golden period of eight brilliant seasons. The show was one of the most critically adored and generally beloved television shows ever to grace the airwaves. Little did anyone know that the sharp decline of one the greatest television shows of all time was just around the corner. Watch an episode of any recent season and you might think Moe gets a cellphone isn’t such an awful idea after all. It certainly beats Moe becomes a judge on American Idol.



The glory years of seasons 1–8 (maybe including some of 9, if we’re being generous) now stand as just the beginning of a show that has ran for 30 seasons (and counting). But so marked has been the show’s decline in quality that you might struggle to find any self-declared Simpsons fans who still tune in regularly, and those who do are likely to do so more out of a sense of obligation than anything else. Even harder to find are those that would defend the modern-day incarnation of the show or claim it’s still as good as it’s ever been (outside of writers, directors, producers, and the voice actors).

The early seasons of the show were a template upon which to build. The Simpsons began to show itself as an equal opportunities offender in its first two seasons. The Simpsons would mock everyone; left and right on the political spectrum, authority figures to everyday families. At times it was more serious in tone than what would come later but the early green shoots of greatness would only grow further, and the soon The Simpsons would become the greatest show on television.

After a couple of promising, often hilarious seasons, The Simpsons came into its own from season 3 onward. Season 3 gave the world numerous classic episodes including “Flaming Moe’s”, “Dog Of Death” and “I Married Marge”. Seasons 4 and 5 gave us “The Last Exit to Springfield” (my personal favorite episode, where Homer battles Mr. Burns as the unwitting head of the worker’s union), “A Streetcar Named Marge”, “Homer’s Barbershop Quartet”, “The Last Temptation Of Homer”, “Cape Feare”… seriously, I could go on with this list for the rest of this.

Season 9 is usually pinpointed as the time when The Simpsons began its slide into irrelevancy. In hindsight, it has some decent episodes, especially when compared to what would come later. Even the infamous, much-derided “The Principal And The Pauper” episode, where it’s revealed that straight-laced Principal Skinner is a street punk fraud with a stolen identity, seems like a veritable classic when compared to just about anything from modern day seasons.

Remarkably the show is still going, eleven seasons past that low point, but it’s running on fumes. I don’t see any way the show can now recapture its former glory. Surely it’s time to put an end to America’s (former) favorite family? We’ll always have the glory years, the constant TV repeats and the DVDs.
Thanks for the memories, The Simpsons, you’ve been great. But we’ve all been watching your decline for too long. It’s time for everyone to be put out of their misery.
